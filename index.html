      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in New Jersey, and I moved down to Texas back in 2010.
        <br>I graduated from Grand Prairie High School in 2011 and I also went to college
        <br> at Dallas County Community College for one full year and have not gone back
        <br> since. Currently taking TeamTreeHouse TechDegree coarse so that I am able
        <br> to create and develop websites for myself and my maybe in the future make it
        <br> a business.  </p>

    <div class="Goals">
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>My goals for the next 3 to 5 months is to be able to complete the TeamTreeHouse
        <br> TechDegree program and see if I can find a job as a front end developer.
        <br> My goals for the next year is get as much experience as possible as a developer
        <br> and maybe learn a new language. However, within one year, I want to see if starting
        <br>a business is possible, if not, I can wait and learn and grow more as a developer.
